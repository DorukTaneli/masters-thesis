\subsubsection{Boat States}
Features describing the current state of the boat. These 18 states are predicted by the state estimator models, using the 60 seconds of state history.

\begin{itemize}
    \item AWS (Apparent Wind Speed)
    \item AWA\_cos, AWA\_sin (Apparent Wind Angle)
    \item TWA\_cos, TWA\_sin (True Wind Angle)
    \item Heading\_ov\_ground\_cos, Heading\_ov\_ground\_sin (Heading over ground)
    \item Heading\_Mag\_cos, Heading\_Mag\_sin (Magnetic heading)
    \item Heading\_True\_cos, Heading\_True\_sin (True heading)
    \item Speed\_ov\_ground (Speed over ground)
    \item Speed\_ov\_surface (Speed over surface)
    \item VMG (Velocity Made Good)
    \item Yaw\_cos, Yaw\_sin, Pitch, Roll (3 dimensions of boat movement)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Boat States - Math}
3 features that are more accurately calculated from previous values mathematically, rather than using ML models, as tested by Charles \cite{charles}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Latitude
    \item Longitude\_cos, Longitude\_sin
\end{itemize}


\clearpage
\subsubsection{Sea States}
The features that describe the sea state, independent from the boat.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Current\_speed (Speed of ocean current)
    \item Current\_direction\_cos, Current\_direction\_sin (Direction of ocean current)
    \item TWS (True Wind Speed)
    \item TWD\_cos, TWD\_sin (True Wind Direction)
    \item Air\_temp (Air temperature)
\end{itemize}
