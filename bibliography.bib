abstract = {Recent developments in deep learning have brought huge breakthroughs in the image processing area, which triggered numerous successful applications and positively impacted the current big data context of Industry 4.0. On the other hand, it is widely known that large amounts of training data are required to train a deep learning model with millions of parameters, which limits its application in many industrial applications where sufficient data resources are lacking. Transfer learning is one of the practical solutions to reduce the data required for training, which tries to reuse learned knowledge for similar tasks. Nevertheless, many technical details of transfer learning implementation are not well documented. Therefore, in this work, two datasets collected from plastics manufacturing processes were studied to investigate different transfer learning approaches and implementation details for high-performance model building under the constraint of limited available training data. Different transfer learning implementations are compared and important technical details are also discussed in this study. Through this study, the minimum number of training samples can be estimated. Transfer learning is compared with the newly developed few-shot learning approach as a brief comparative study. Finally, this work summarizes practical guidelines for the development of image classification models with limited data resources.}

abstract="This paper describes the Robosail project. It started in 1997 with the aim to build a self-learning auto pilot for a single handed sailing yacht. The goal was to make an adaptive system that would help a single handed sailor to go faster on average in a race. Presently, after five years of development and a number of sea trials, we have a commercial system available (www.robosail.com). It is a hybrid system using agent technology, machine learning, data mining and rule-based reasoning. Apart from describing the system we try to generalize our findings, and argue that sailing is an interesting paradigm for a class of hybrid systems that one could call Skill-based Systems.",
